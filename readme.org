Is it possible to transfer informations faster than light ?
Without any doubts, yes.
The receiver just have to brutforce the missing informations.
** Sender
- The size of the file
- \n
- The hash of the file (let's use sha512)
- \n
- The file itself
** Receiver
- Get the size and the hash of the file
- Start receiving the file itself
- Start brutforcing the missing informations
